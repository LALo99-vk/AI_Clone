# AI Digital Clone for Work Delegation

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building an AI-powered digital clone capable of assisting users
with work delegation, task handling, scheduling meetings, and communication automation.
The system simulates intelligent decision-making using AI models and backend services.

## Problem Statement
Managing tasks, meetings, and communication manually is time-consuming and inefficient.
There is a need for an intelligent assistant that can automate work delegation and
support users with smart task execution.

## Proposed Solution
The AI Digital Clone automates task delegation, meeting scheduling, and email notifications
by integrating AI models with backend logic and a user-friendly frontend dashboard.
The system reduces manual effort and improves productivity by acting as a virtual assistant.

## Objectives
- To design an AI-powered digital clone for work delegation
- To automate task assignment and execution
- To enable smart scheduling of meetings
- To provide email-based notifications
- To build a scalable and modular system architecture

## System Architecture
The project is divided into the following components:

- **Frontend**: User interface for interaction with the AI clone
- **Backend**: API services, AI processing, and request handling
- **AI Models**: Used for intelligent task understanding and response generation
- **Database**: Stores user data, tasks, and system logs
